Market Trading Bot (Development Language: .NET, C#, JavaScript, AJAX)

Market Trading Bot is a complex system that automates financial transactions. In this project, I carried out trading transactions on 10 different exchanges and 2 decentralized exchanges. 
I also wrote advanced trading strategies algorithms such as Grid Strategy and Market Making Strategy.

Features

I maximized the user experience by creating customer and admin panels customized to the needs of the users.
I performed visualization operations to provide real-time data to users by pulling instant chart information for each exchange.
I used Metamask API and blockchain tools like Etherscan for Metamask wallet integration and tracking of payment transactions so that users could use the strategies.
Technical details

By creating a timer algorithm that constantly checks complex transactions in the background, I ensured effective management of transactions in the stock exchanges.
I used factory and singleton design patterns to achieve this.
I transformed my system, which I wrote with N-layer architecture, into a modular and extensible structure.
By using the benefits offered by the Web3 library, I created a stronger and more reliable infrastructure in my project.
I developed an extensible and modular trading bot that can automate complex financial transactions. This bot can quickly adapt to market conditions by applying different strategies and become 
an effective tool to increase investors' profitability. Additionally, it can meet the needs of all kinds of investors, thanks to its customizability according to users' preferences. 
As a result, it offers an ideal solution for anyone who wants to trade successfully in the financial markets.
